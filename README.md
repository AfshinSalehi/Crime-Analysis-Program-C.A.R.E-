# Crime-Analysis-Program-(C.A.R.E)
-A QGIS 2.x plugin Program that analyzes crime to features and attributes of the city.

-You have to copy all the files and folders to your Qgis plugins repository and you're ready to go.

This plugin is built around a complex calculation which has developed by me (Salehi@consultant.com). I've also published it as a research paper. It finds all the features and their attributes around the crime points and tries to develope a meaningful relation between them. a richer cloud of data would get better answers. It will publish a PDF report to show the crime/features/attributes statistics as its output.
It could be a very helpful tool for crime analysts, urban planners, police, and etc...

It's developed for Windows, but with a few simple changes you can use it on Linux too.
