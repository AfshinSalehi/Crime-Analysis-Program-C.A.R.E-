about=This plugin developed as a fine solution to determine crimes and environment hidden relations. Although in case of success it will develop to a standalone CIS software with many more abilities like showing objects on the canvas, direct user interaction, etc... The algorithm of this plugin designed as the key point which proceeds to a fully functional crime predictor which haven't yet created worldwide. it's true that some softwares like Esri's crime analyst or grassGIS have some solutions but having a flawlessly practical tool on the other hand is the true advantage. Also, it will provoke a new theory in statistical correlations as it can find out the hidden relations between human psychic decisions and the environment.
